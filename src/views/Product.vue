              Random bug titles on your bug reports aren't your thing?

              This new feature improves the session list experience as it hints
              at what the bug report might be about and provides an easy way to
              refer to it when talking to others. Workspace admins can select
              this by heading to their Workspace >> General settings.

              Another exciting release feature this week: console support for

              Functional components, props, children and more! Be ready to spot
              objects on our console marked with the React logo.

              <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                Another exciting feature release this week: link unfurling.

              <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                When you share a Bird public bug report link in apps like Slack,
                Notion, or LinkedIn, additional context about the link (e.g.,
                session title, description, and screenshots) is auto-appended to
                the message and displayed immediately, adding continuity to
                conversations.

              <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                Note: link unfurling only works for public bug reports (since

              <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                We've gathered a lot of feedback from user interviews, our
                community, and analytics and made some essential refinements to
                our extension. We refreshed our design, making our instant

                Meet Collections, a better way to organize your sessions
              </h3>
              <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                Today’s release adds the ability to create collections to
                organize your sessions.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                This is especially useful for people who use Bird beyond just
                bug reporting. Here’s an example: You can create a collection
                called Bugs where you store all your bug reports, and a
                collection called Demos, which houses explanation videos for
                your remote team members or even end users. Collections can be
                also used to group recordings by sprint. You can rename,
                archive, and delete Collections to further personalize your Bird
                workspace.
