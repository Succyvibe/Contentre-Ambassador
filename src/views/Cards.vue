              Writing Portfolio Examples from Clippings.me
            </h2>
            <p class="leading-6">
              If your job involves writing or if you’re looking to break into a
              field that requires it, your writing samples will play a huge role
              in the positions you’re able to land and the opportunities
              available to you. You need a way to showcase your work and make
              yourself stand out in front of readers, editors and hiring
              managers.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              Clippings.me is a free service that allows writers, journalists
              and bloggers to create a free online portfolio of their work.
              Setup can be completed in minutes and there’s no coding required.
              If you’re ready to get started building your online writing
              portfolio and promoting your work, read on to learn how to do it
              and see several examples of portfolios that stand out.

              Building a Portfolio
            </h2>
            <p class="leading-6">
              The first step to building a portfolio is to
              <a href="#">sign up for a free Clippings.me account</a>. It’s
              simple, free, and only takes a minute. If you want to make the
              process even faster, you can opt to connect your profile to your
              Twitter account and automatically import your bio and avatar.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              Once you’re registered, you’ll be prompted to pick a theme for the
              look and feel of your portfolio; don’t worry, you can always go
              back and change this later. Then enter a bit more information
              about yourself to complete your bio. This might include education,
              previous work experience, topics you like to write about, relevant
              industry memberships, awards, and so on. Think of your
              Clippings.me bio like a bite-sized version of your resume.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              Next, add your writing samples. You can do this by uploading
              static files from your computer or by linking to pieces that exist
              elsewhere online. You can add up to ten samples free of charge.
              Finally, add dividers and categorize your work. You can categorize
              it by topic, by the place it was published, by format, or in any
              other way that makes sense for your particular work
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2 class="text-[1.5em] leading-6 font-semibold mb-6">
              What Makes a Good Portfolio on Clippings.me?
            </h2>
            <p class="leading-6">
              It goes without saying that you’ll want to fill your portfolio
              with pieces you’re proud of, but a good Clippings.me portfolio is
              about more than just showcasing your top work. The best portfolios
              help the viewer get a feel for who the writer is and what he or
              she does best.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              For example, if you’re seeking opportunities to cover politics, it
              wouldn’t make a lot of sense to fill your portfolio with soft,
              feature pieces, even if they’re great writing. Instead, you’d want
              to use samples that demonstrate your political expertise,
              interviewing prowess and objective approach.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              Or, perhaps you’re a blogger who wants to turn writing into a
              full-time career. Though that funny post about your embarrassing
              college story got a bunch of likes on social media, it’s probably
              not the best sample you want to put forth in front of people who
              might be looking to hire you.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              When selecting samples for your portfolio, ask yourself this: what
              impression do I want to make on people who see this? This will be
              a great compass to help you choose the right work samples to
              include.

            <p class="leading-6">
              The great thing about Clippings.me is that it was designed by
              writers, for writers, so it’s an intuitive way to organize many
              different kinds of writing. Here are a few examples of the types
              of portfolios you can create on Clippings.me and some quick tips

              Multimedia Journalist
            </h2>
            <p class="leading-6">
              Any content creator worth their salt knows that words alone are
              rarely enough to make a compelling story. Today’s readers seek an
              immersive experience that includes visuals, audio, interactive
              content and even newer mediums like virtual reality. Clippings.me
              is the perfect platform to showcase a broad range of multimedia
              content and your skills producing it.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              Digital content creator Anne Gould is a great example of a writer
              who uses Clippings.me to showcase work in various multimedia
              formats. She has sections of her portfolio dedicated specifically
              to video and photo content and explicitly states in her bio that
              one of her core interests is telling stories through video. If
              there’s an editor out there looking for a visual content creator,
              Anne makes it easy for them to see why she’s a shoo-in for the
              role.

              Not all writing is exposition. Dominica Taylor uses Clippings.me
              to showcase her copywriting work that helps brands establish their
              identity in front of prospective customers. This includes website
              copy, product descriptions and various marketing materials.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              Dominica has added visuals to each sample to show how her writing
              comes to life when combined with creative package design and
              digital development. This would be an effective portfolio type for
              you if you write copy for ads, social media posts, printed
              materials or any other form of marketing collateral.

              <a href="#"> Will Nacouzi</a> is a student who uses his

              that he’s looking for internships and other opportunities to hone
              his skills as a writer. He also notes that he’s already earned his
              associate’s degree in journalism, which demonstrates his active
              commitment to advance in a career as a journalist. He uses the

            <p class="leading-6">
              Blogging is a unique animal in that it can take so many different
              forms. Some writers blog as a hobby, others as a full-time
              profession. Some blog on serious journalistic topics like foreign
              affairs, others write about comic books or healthy cooking.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              The beauty of Clippings.me is that it helps bloggers of all
              stripes position their work as more than just some ramblings on
              the internet. By creating a Clippings.me portfolio, you can help
              demonstrate the common thread that ties your blogging together in
              a professional-looking way.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              <a href="#"> Jacqueline Smith</a> is a great example of this.
              She’s been in the blogging game a long time and uses her
              Clippings.me portfolio to demonstrate her expertise in a specific
              area: urban gardening.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              Because her writing on this topic appears on many different blogs
              and media outlets, it would be hard to track her down as an expert
              via a simple Google search. But by using Clippings.me, she easily
              groups all her related work in one place, showing editors her
              broad experience writing about a rather niche topic.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-6">
              There’s one more thing most great Clippings.me portfolios have in
              common: they give the reader additional ways to connect with the
              writer. Whether it’s by linking your social media profiles,
              sharing the link to your personal website or including your email
              address, be sure to round out your Clippings.me portfolio by
              giving the viewer a way to take the next step in building a
              relationship with you.
